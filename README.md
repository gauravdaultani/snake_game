<h1>Snake Game in C</h1>

<p>This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C. The game is designed to be played in the console providing a nostalgic gaming experience. It's a great project for those looking to practice their C programming skills or for anyone who just loves playing Snake.</p>

### How to Play

*   Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction: Up Down Left and Right.
